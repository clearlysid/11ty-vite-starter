    "content": "A Hackathon is an intense event that brings together designers and developers along with industry experts to identify problems and create software solutions, usually within 24-48 hours. If you're a female or non-binary student developer, we'd love to have you at H4I! Whether that's high school, undergrad, or graduate, we believe you can get something out of the event."

  {
    "title": "How much does it cost?",
    "content": "Zero. Zip. Zilch. Nada. Nothing. Admission to Hackout is completely free for everyone!"
  },
  {
    "title": "What if I don't want to present my hack?",
    "content": "Unfinished or unimpressive (so you think) projects should be presented anyway! Presenting your hack gives you a chance to be proud of what you’ve done, and a constructive perspective of where you should be headed next."
  },
  {
    "title": "Can we apply as a team?",
    "content": "Yes! This hackathon is strictly a team competition. We believe that you’re stronger as a team than you are apart. You can join or create a team once you've started an individual application."

    "title": "How big can a team be?",
    "content": "Up to 4 people large! Pro Tip: Aim to have a mix of people with both design and developer skills"

  {
    "title": "What if I don't have a team or an idea?",
    "content": " Don't worry, most people don’t! We’ll have team formation and ideation events geared towards helping you find people to work with. It’s perfectly normal to go around to people, tell them you’re looking for a team, and ask if you can help out. You can also show yourself off at #teamup!"

  {
    "title": "Can I attend talks + workshops without being accepted for the hackathon?",
    "content": "Yes! The conference is going to be open to everyone who's interested. We will keep you folks updated with the schedule and the links to the talks."
